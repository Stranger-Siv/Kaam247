## 🌐 Network Issue

Both ports 22 and 443 are blocked by your network/firewall.

**Solutions:**
1. **Try different network** (mobile hotspot, different WiFi)
2. **Use GitHub Desktop** (may work even if CLI doesn't)
3. **Wait and retry** (network issues are often temporary)
4. **Check VPN/Firewall** (disconnect VPN, check settings)

## 📦 Backup Files Created

If needed, you can share these files:
- `kaam247-changes.patch` - Patch file with your changes
- `kaam247-changes.bundle` - Git bundle with your commit

## 🚀 Quick Push Commands

Once network is working:

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Push to GitHub
git push

# If using SSH (current setup)
git push origin main

# If switched back to HTTPS
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Stranger-Siv/Kaam247.git
git push
```

**Your code is safe and ready!** Just need network connectivity to push. 🎯
