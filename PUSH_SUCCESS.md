# ✅ Push Successful!

## 🎉 Your Changes Are Now on GitHub

**Solution**: Switched from SSH to HTTPS

## 📊 What Happened

1. **SSH port 22**: Blocked by network
2. **SSH port 443**: Also blocked
3. **HTTPS port 443**: ✅ Works!
4. **Switched remote**: From SSH to HTTPS
5. **Push successful**: All commits pushed

## 🔧 Current Configuration

**Remote URL**: `https://github.com/Stranger-Siv/Kaam247.git`

**To push in future**:

git push
```

## 📦 Commits Pushed

All your production fixes are now on GitHub:
- Socket.IO disabled

- API test script created

## 💡 For Future Pushes

HTTPS is now configured. Just use:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push
```

If you need to authenticate, GitHub will prompt for:
- Username: `Stranger-Siv`
- Password: Use a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

## 🔐 Personal Access Token (If Needed)

If GitHub asks for authentication:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo`
4. Copy token and use as password
